# X-Wing Simulator 

###### This is the X-Wing Simulator I designed for OOP Assignment #1, It's designed to a replcia of an Incom T95 X-Wing Fighter's cockpit from the Starwars Saga. I roughly took inspiration from this image

######  The Simulation starts with the Star wars Crawling Titles from the movies, which I replicated using the same fonts and a simple translation in the simulator, this can be skipped by pressing the spacebar
###### You are then brought to the main simulation, you can press the spacebar, to enter hyperspace, and the arrow keys to navigate real space at sublight speeds. None of the controls on the console will be usuable when moving 
###### Planets should appear as you move through space growing in size and moving off screen before you reach them, the speed you are moving through space will be displayed on a bar, on the left of the HUD
###### You can click the red button on the right hand side to start training mode, here you can shoot the laser that appears when you click the mouse in the area of space to destroy a random spawning tie fighter, if you fire more than 3 times you will need to wait 5~ seconds for the laser to cool down
###### Hovering over a planet or a spawned tie will display information about it in the center console of the control panel, you can also hover over the image of your X-Wing to the right on the console to display info about the ship such as shield status, ammo, how many ties you have destroyed
###### The radar to the right of the console will display the position of spawned ties and planets on screen
